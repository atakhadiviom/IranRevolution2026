# Care, Visibility & Data Protocol

Guidelines for contributors and maintainers of Iran Memorial.

This document outlines the community guidelines for contributing to Iran Memorial. The goal is to support an archive that honors people with dignity (not reducing them to numbers), while also respecting real safety risks faced by families and contributors.

Not all items below may be implemented in the repository today. They are recommended practices and a direction for the project as it grows.

## 1. Why we document names

When families and communities choose to share names, this can be:
- An act of dignity and remembrance.
- A refusal of erasure and silence.
- A way to support historical accountability.

Naming should never be forced, automated, or assumed.

## 2. Visibility is a choice, not an obligation

Contributors should be able to choose different levels of visibility depending on safety and consent.
Examples:
- Full name visible.
- First name only.
- Initials or pseudonym.
- Anonymous entry with descriptive context.

No option is morally superior. Safety and consent come first. Visibility choices may change over time.

## 3. Protecting families and contributors (data minimization)

Contributors should avoid including:
- Home addresses or precise locations.
- Contact details or private social accounts.
- Identifiable information about living relatives.
- Details that could enable targeting, surveillance, or retaliation.

When in doubt, share less detail and prioritize protection.

### 3.1 Social media sources require extra care

Much of the available documentation may come from social media posts. Even if contributors are anonymous, the people mentioned in posts (victims, families, witnesses, posters) may be identifiable and at risk.

Recommended practice when using social media as a source:
- Prefer linking/citing public, reputable sources when available (e.g., trusted organizations, major reporting), especially when social posts include sensitive details.
- Do not copy/paste or republish identifying details from posts that could put families or witnesses at risk.
- Avoid re-sharing usernames/handles, personal accounts, or direct links when those could enable targeting or harassment. Consider summarizing instead.
- Treat social posts as potentially incomplete or misleading; do not assume they are verified.
- If a post is later deleted or contested, consider reducing visibility (redaction/anonymization) and note uncertainty.

When in doubt, prioritize safety over completeness.

## 4. Consent and the right to change

Recommended practice:
- If family consent is known, respect their wishes about naming and visibility.
- If consent is unknown, default to cautious visibility.
- Provide a clear path for requests for correction, anonymization, or removal.
- Handle those requests quickly and respectfully.

Corrections and removals are part of ethical care, not failures.

## 5. Sources, uncertainty, and responsibility

Recommended practice:
- When possible, include a source (public reporting, trusted organizations, public statements).
- If information is uncertain or contested, state this clearly.
- Do not speculate or infer missing details.

It is acceptable for entries to remain partial or evolving.

## 6. Community moderation with care

Moderation guidelines:
- Prioritize the dignity of the person remembered.
- Prioritize safety of families and contributors.
- Use respectful, non-sensational language.
- Be transparent about uncertainty.

When disagreements arise:
- Pause and clarify concerns.
- Prefer redaction or reduced visibility over rejection.
- Escalate only when necessary.
- Maintain respectful communication.

Care work is real labor and should be shared.

## 7. Use of AI (extraction & assistance only)

This repository includes AI-related code intended to assist with extracting structured candidate information from publicly available posts/sources (e.g., possible names, dates, locations, or multiple victims). This is meant to reduce manual labor and not to determine truth.

Recommended safeguards:
- Treat AI outputs as unverified suggestions.
- Require human review before anything is added to the memorial.
- Do not let AI invent or infer names, identities, causes of death, relationships, or missing facts.
- If something is unclear, leave it empty or mark it as uncertain rather than guessing.
- If extraction surfaces sensitive or risky personal details, prioritize safety and redaction over completeness.
- Avoid presenting AI outputs publicly as authoritative.

AI should remain a support tool, not judgment, authorship, or verification.

## 8. This protocol is living

As risks, contexts, and community needs evolve, this protocol can be updated. If something feels unsafe or unclear, please open an issue or start a discussion.

Memory work is a collective responsibility.
